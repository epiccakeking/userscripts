# Userscripts
A collection of some small userscripts (of varying quality) that I have written, most only make minor changes that may or may not be useful.

These scripts are all unofficial and are not made by or otherwise endorsed by the respective websites they are for.

Each userscript will be in a directory with the name of the website it applies to.

To use you will first need to install a userscript extension like Violentmonkey or Tampermonkey. Then navigate to the file for the userscript you want on GitHub and click the "Raw" button to install the userscript.

Please do not submit pull requests unless you are fixing a bug.
