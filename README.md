# Userscripts
A collection of some small userscripts that I have written.

Each userscript will be in a directory with the name of the website it applies to.

To use you will first need to install a userscript extension like Violentmonkey or Tampermonkey. Then navigate to the file for the userscript you want on GitHub and click the "Raw" button to install the userscript.

Since this repo is only for userscripts I have written, I will not be accepting pull requests for new userscripts (though I may accept bug fixes).
